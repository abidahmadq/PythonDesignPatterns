- Design Principles by Robert 
- sRP or sOC -> single reponibility principle or seperation of concern
- Anti pattern
  - Example -> God Object -> A massive class with multiple responsibility.
- Open-Closed Principle
- LSP -> If we have some interface with some base class. If we have a derived class we should be able to use it directly 
- ISP -> Interface Segregation Principle.
- DIP -> Dependency Inversion Principle. Does not directly relate to dependency injection.
