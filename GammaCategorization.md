- Design Patterns are typically split into three categories
- Creational Patterns
  - Deal with creation of objects.
  - Explicit(constructor) vs implicit(DI, reflection etc)
  - Wholesale vs piecewise
- Structural Patterns
  - Concerned with the structure(eg class members)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
  - Stress the importance of a good API design.
- Behavioral Patterns
  - They are different; central theme
